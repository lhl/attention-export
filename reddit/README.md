Reddit only gives access to the last 1000 items via API.

Workarounds:
* For your own comments or submissions you can use Pushshift to get older data.
* For saved items, you can unsave items to get older items. You can use multiple categories if you are Gold/Premium to get 1000 items/category https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/d4ejn7/solved_download_all_saves_in_my_account/
* For upvotes, while the data is stored internally, it is mostly inaccessible, even if you unvote items: https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/7v857g/im_trying_to_bypass_the_1000_upvoted_posts_limit/

If you want to get your upvotes especially, it's important to regularly collect your upvotes before you hit the 1000 limit. 

You can combine various listing orders, but that doesn't work for upvotes: https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/6c38dz/a_desperate_plea_please_let_me_bypass_the/
