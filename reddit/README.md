Reddit only gives access to the last 1000 items via API.

Workarounds:
* For your own comments or submissions you can use Pushshift to get older data.
* For saved items, you can unsave items to get older items. You can use multiple categories if you are Gold/Premium to get 1000 items/category
* For upvotes, while the data is stored internally, it is mostly inaccessible, even if you unvote items: https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/7v857g/im_trying_to_bypass_the_1000_upvoted_posts_limit/

If you want to get your upvotes especially, it's important to regularly collect your upvotes before you hit the 1000 limit.
